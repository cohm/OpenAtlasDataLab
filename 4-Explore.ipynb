    "You're now ready for the main exercise, to try to discover a particle in the data from the ATLAS experiment! There are a few short-lived particles that you can find in the provided dataset, and we have discussed one recently discovered particle more than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many particles can also be discovered through several different decay channels, and by looking at [for what final states](https://atlas-opendata.web.cern.ch/atlas-opendata/samples/2020/) data and simulations are provided and combining with recent lecture notes, you can get some ideas. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are having trouble getting started, the slides from the last two lectures provide some inspiration!\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to read through [5-Report](5-Report.ipynb) already now - then you know what you're expected to include in your report, and the instructions might also include some ideas that could help you. As these instructions explain, you can choose your level of ambition depending on what final grade you want to try to get for the full course:\n",
    "* For grades E, D or C: identifying a peak corresponding to the particle in the invariant-mass spectrum in the data is sufficient, if you can argue well that the peak can not be due to background processes.\n",
    "* For grades B or A: in addition to the above, use MC simulations to predict what the signal you're searching for will look like (if they are available - ask me if you're not sure!), and for the main background processes - this helps to build confidence that you're interpreting the data correctly.\n",

    "PS. The $Z$ boson does not count since we used it as an example, but all other short-lived particles you can reconstruct from their decay products are ok! Decays that can be reconstructed fully, i.e. where all the decay products are measured, are generally easier, and those with low backgrounds from other processes are strongly recommended too."
